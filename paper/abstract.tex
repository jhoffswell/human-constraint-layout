  Graph layout has long been the focus of research across domains, leading to many customized layout techniques based on aesthetic and domain specific information. However, producing effective layouts often requires both domain and programming expertise. In response, we present a high-level constraint language for graph layout. The user specifies layout constraints over sets of nodes, which we convert to inter-node constraints for WebCoLa (a JavaScript library for constraint based graph layout). We show that users can compactly specify complex graph layouts that resemble those produced by customized layout engines and identify design considerations and areas for future work.
