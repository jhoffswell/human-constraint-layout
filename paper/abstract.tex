  Graph layout is a well-studied problem, leading to many customized layout techniques for graphs across different domains. However, producing effective layouts often requires both a high-level of domain and programming expertise. In response, we present a high-level constraint language for graph layout. The user specifies layout constraints over sets of nodes, which we convert to inter-node constraints for WebCola (a JavaScript library for constraint based graph layout). We show that users can compactly specify complex graph layouts that resemble those produced by customized layout engines.
