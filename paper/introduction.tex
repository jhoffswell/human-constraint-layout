\section{Introduction}
Graphs are common across a number of domains including social network analysis \cite{scott1988social,travers1967small,granovetter1973strength,watts1998collective,freeman1978centrality}, biological systems \cite{barsky2007cerebral,shannon2003cytoscape,gehlenborg2010visualization,saraiya2005visualizing}, and ecological networks \cite{hinke2004visualizing,harper2006dynamic,lavigne1996cod,baskerville2011spatial,yodzis1998local,cohen2003ecological,kearney2016blog,benson2016higher}. In order to highlight relevant trends in the data, it is important for the graph layout to utilize domain specific details when drawing the network. In response, domain specific layout engines have been developed to address the needs of particular domains \cite{barsky2007cerebral,shannon2003cytoscape,kearney2017d3,kearney2017ecopath,gawron2016pss}.

When an existing tool does not exist for the domain of interest, the user is required to either fit their data to one of the available tools or create a customized layout. Creating such a customized layout often requires either a high level of programming expertise or time, which may be infeasible. This tradeoff leaves a gap between the domain-specific analysis needs of some disciplines and the availability of tools to handle those needs.

In response, we present a high-level constraint language for graph layout. This approach allows the user to easily create a new layout customized for their needs while deferring calculation of the layout to the underlying system. The user focuses on expressing the main layout properties of interest by specifying constraints over sets of node in the graph. Our system then converts these constraints to inter-node constraints for WebCola \cite{WebCoLa}, a Javascript library for constraint based graph layout. Users can then tune properties of the layout by modifying preferences for WebCola or otherwise modifying the graph with D3 \cite{bostock:d3}.

We show that users can compactly specify complex graph layouts that resemble those produced by customized layout engines. We further discuss the scalability and efficiency of this technique in terms of \blue{runtime} and number of constraints generated. Finally, we propose design considerations for future work.
