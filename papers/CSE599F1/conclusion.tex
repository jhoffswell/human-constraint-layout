\section{Conclusion}
Visualizations of graph data can provide a powerful way to view and explore complex structural information in large graphs. Such visualizations are often more effective at communicating relevant information if they take advantage of domain specific properties in the layout. But creating customized layouts requires both domain and programming expertise, which may often be infeasible. In this work, we presented a high-level constraint language for specifying customized graph layouts and a system for generating \mbox{WebCoLa} constraints based on our constraint specifications. We showed that our constraint language can produce highly compact, domain specific layouts that closely resemble those produced for real-world use cases. We further outlines design considerations and areas for future work.
