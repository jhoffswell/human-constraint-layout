Constraints enable flexible graph layouts that combine the ease of
automatic layouts with designs customized to the particular
domain. However, constraint-based layouts often require individual
constraints over node pairs. Such constraints are specific to the
particular graph and thus cannot generalize to other graphs in the same
domain. To facilitate the specification of customized and generalizable
constraint layouts, we contribute \projectname: a domain-specific language
for specifying high-level constraints relative to properties of the backing
data. Users identify node sets based on data or graph properties and apply
high-level constraints within each set of nodes. Applying constraints to
node sets rather than on individual nodes reduces specification
effort. \projectname~also facilitates reapplication of customized layouts
across distinct graphs by separating the constraint specification from
individual properties of the nodes. We demonstrate the conciseness,
generalizability, and expressiveness of \projectname~on a series of
real-world examples from ecological networks, biological systems, and
social networks.
