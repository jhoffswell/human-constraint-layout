\begin{document}
\maketitle

In our paper, we showed how SetCoLa could be used to recreate Cerebral 
layouts for the TLR4 network. We demonstrate 
the reapplication of a similar SetCoLa specification across networks 
extracted from InnateDB. InnateDB \cite{breuer2012innatedb} is a public 
database containing a large quantity of biological information and is 
integrated with analytic and visualization tools. For example, the database 
is integrated with Cerebral \cite{barsky2008cerebral} to enable visualization 
of properties such as protein interactions or signaling pathways. The 
general specification used for each layout is shown in Figure \ref{fig:specification}.
We selected four networks from InnateDB to recreate with the layout. For 
each one, we apply the same specification and show the result produced with
SetCoLa as compared to the visualization produced by Cerebral.

To demonstrate the reapplication of a SetCoLa specification for similar
graphs in the same domain, we used four examples from InnateDB: 
the TLR4 network~(Figure \ref{fig:tlr4Innate}, \cite{innatedb:tlr4}), 
the DDX58 network~(Figure \ref{fig:ddx58Innate}, \cite{innatedb:ddx58}), 
the NOD-like signaling pathway~(Figure \ref{fig:nodInnate}, \cite{innatedb:nod}), 
and the MAPK1 network~(Figure \ref{fig:mapk1Innate}, \cite{innatedb:mapk1}).
The full specification and data for each example is included in the other 
supplementary materials, along with the other specifications from the paper.
For each figure, we added custom labels to match the labels produced by
Cerebral in order to facilitate the comparison between the two layouts.
These examples show that that layout can easily be reapplied across
different graphs using the same SetCoLa specification. 

While the SetCoLa specification works well for the TLR4 network, DDX58 
network, and NOD-like signaling pathway, the specification produces an 
undesirable result for the MAPK1 network (Figure \ref{fig:mapk1Innate}b). 
This graph produces a much more flattened version of the network because 
it has over twice the number of nodes as the other networks (e.g., 240 
nodes as compared to about 100 in the smaller networks). In this case, 
the constants used in the specification are not particularly ideal for 
the larger network. Future work should explore better techniques for 
applying spacing relative to graph properties rather than constant 
values. An improved version of the MAPK1 network (with reduced spacing 
on the nodes in the ``Nucleus'' layer) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mapk1Innate}c.
One of the other main differences between the SetCoLa and Cerebral specifications is
the rendering style for the links, which uses a bundled routing style in Cerebral.
Such a rendering style could be added to SetCoLa in the future to achieve this effect.

    and constraints on the size of each layer produces an undesirable
    layout for the larger graph as compared to the smaller alternatives
    (Figures \ref{fig:tlr4Innate}, \ref{fig:ddx58Innate}, \ref{fig:nodInnate}).
    (c) By adding an additional constraint to reduce the spacing, we can
    achieve a more desirable layout for this graph.
