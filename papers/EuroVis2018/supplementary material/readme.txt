In this file, we include the SetCoLa specification for each example shown
in the paper (named '*-SetCoLa.json'). For each example, we also include
the WebCoLa specification that is generated by the SetCoLa compiler
(named '*-WebCoLa.json'). We also include the SetCoLa specification for
each visualization shown in the other supplementary material titled 
"Reapplication of SetCoLa Specifications for Biological Networks" that
demonstrates how a SetCoLa specification can be reapplied across multiple
graphs from the same domain.
