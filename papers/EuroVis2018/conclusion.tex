\section{Conclusion}
We present \projectname: a domain-specific language for specifying high-level
constraints for customized graph layouts. \projectname enables concise 
specification of graphs by allowing users to apply constraints over sets
of nodes rather than on individual nodes. These customized layouts can
be easily reapplied to different graphs that share domain-specific properties.
We implemented \projectname in WebCoLa and demonstrate the expressiveness
of this technique for several real-world examples from ecological networks,
biological systems, and social networks. These specifications reduce the
number of constraints written by the user while still enabling flexible
constraints for the graph data.
