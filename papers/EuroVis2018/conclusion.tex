\section{Conclusion}
We present \projectname: a domain-specific language for specifying high-level
constraints for customized graph layout. \projectname enables concise 
specification of layouts by applying constraints to node sets
rather than individual nodes. These customized layouts can
be reapplied to different graphs that share domain-specific properties.
We implemented \projectname using the WebCoLa library~\cite{WebCoLa} and demonstrate the expressiveness
of \projectname on real-world examples from ecological networks,
biological systems, and social networks. \projectname specifications reduce the
number of constraints written by the user by one to two orders of magnitude,
while enabling flexible and reusable domain-specific layouts.
