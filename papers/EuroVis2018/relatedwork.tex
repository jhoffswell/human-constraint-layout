\section{Related Work}

A great deal of prior work has contributed to graph visualization.
We discuss general layout techniques and constraint approaches
that motivate this work, then expand upon domain-specific layouts.

\subsection{General Graph Layout}
Graph layout approaches often leverage the graph structure to produce the 
layout \cite{herman2000graph,eades2010graph,gibson2013survey}.
For node-link diagrams of hierarchical data, Reingold \& Tilford's ``tidy'' 
layout~\cite{reingold1981tidier} arranges graph nodes to
produce compact, symmetrical tree layouts.
Radial layouts \cite{battista1998graph,herman2000graph} follow similar procedures using polar 
coordinates, with a root node placed at the origin.
Sugiyama-style layouts~\cite{sugiyama1981methods} visualize directed graphs by first assigning nodes to hierarchical layers and then iteratively adjusting node placement to minimize edge crossings.
Force-directed techniques~\cite{tutte1963draw,kobourov2012spring,quinn1979forced,fruchterman1991graph} 
use physical simulation and/or optimization methods that model repulsive forces between nodes and spring-like forces on edges, and attempt to minimize the overall energy. 
A number of popular tools support graph drawing, including D3.js~\cite{bostock:d3}, Gephi~\cite{bastian2009gephi},
Graphviz~\cite{ellson2001graphviz}, and Cytoscape~\cite{shannon2003cytoscape}.

\subsection{Constraint-Based Layout Techniques}
Extending an existing layout method to support constraints enables
customized layouts that may emphasize important
structural or aesthetic properties of the graph. 
Dig-CoLa~\cite{dwyer2005dig} encodes the hierarchy of nodes as constraints
and attempts to minimize the stress on the overall graph layout; this strategy
combines automatic hierarchical layout with undirected layouts for a hybrid
visualization strategy that can ensure downward pointing edges to more
effectively represent the graph hierarchy. \mbox{IPSep-CoLa~\cite{dwyer2006ipsep}} extends
force-directed layout to apply a more general class of separation constraints 
on pairs of nodes. This strategy allows the user to introduce constraints to enforce properties 
such as downward pointing edges or ordering based on node properties.
Dwyer and Robertson~\cite{dwyer2009layout} present a strategy for supporting 
non-linear constraints (such circle constraints) that does not constrain node
positions along a single, but can incorporate these techniques within
alternative layout strategies.

For use in a web-programming context, WebCoLa~\cite{WebCoLa} is a 
JavaScript library for constraint-based layout that can be used alongside
D3~\cite{bostock:d3} or Cytoscape~\cite{shannon2003cytoscape}.
WebCoLa supports the specification of constraints on the alignment and relative
position of nodes as well as high-level properties such as flow (to ensure
edges point in the same direction) and non-overlapping constraints.
Kieffer et al.~\cite{kieffer2013incremental} present a force-directed,
constraint-based layout for creating graphs with node and edge alignment.
Kieffer et al. show that this strategy is effective even for interactive refinement 
by incorporating it into the interactive graph layout system Dunnart~\cite{dwyer2008dunnart}. 
These constraint-based layout techniques are often used to emphasize structural properties of
the graph such as hierarchy or containment. While WebCoLa can support 
customized constraints in addition to more general structural constraints,
the specification of individual inter-node constraints can be labor intensive.
\projectname aims to reduce the burden of specifying customized constraints
to enable the design of domain-specific and generalizable layouts.

\subsection{Domain-Specific Graph Visualization}
Several techniques have been developed to reflect domain-specific concerns
within graph layouts. However, these techniques
tend to be highly-specialized, and so may not apply to other possible
domains of interest. For example, ecological networks are a common visualization
to include in publications to show the relationships amongst organisms in
an ecosystem. Baskerville~et~al.\ produced a customized visualization of 
the Serengeti food web~\cite{baskerville2011spatial} in which the nodes
are positioned based on their trophic level (e.g., the role of the
organism within the larger food chain) and further grouped based on a
Bayesian classification of the elements;  in addition to the 
static visualization, Baskerville~et~al.\ 
published an interactive version of the graph online~\cite{baskerville2011interactive}. 

Despite frequently publishing visualizations showing ocean food 
webs~\cite{kearney2012coupling,kearney2013amplification},
Kearney describes several challenges around the design of such visualizations
in a blog post~\cite{kearney2016blog}; Kearney notes that the node
placement algorithm should \emph{``allow constraining y-position to match
  trophic level while allowing free movement in the x-direction. With no
  such algorithm seemingly readily available, I decided to create my
  own.''} Kearney developed plugins for D3~\cite{kearney2017d3} and
Ecopath~\cite{kearney2017ecopath} to produce food webs visualizations. 
Motivated by the challenges described by Kearney, \projectname aims to provide users
with a lightweight means for authoring domain-specific constraints for customized layouts.

Biological systems is another domain requiring customized visualizations.
Cerebral~\cite{barsky2008cerebral} is a tool designed to visualize
biological systems and supports interactive exploration of different
experimental conditions. Genc and Dogrusoz~\cite{genc2003constrained}
describe a constrained force-directed layout technique for visualizing 
biological pathways. Cytoscape~\cite{shannon2003cytoscape} is a
visualization system designed to explore biomolecular interaction networks
and provides a framework for accepting customized plugins, including 
a WebCoLa~\cite{WebCoLa} plugin for constraint-based layouts. 

Kieffer et al.'s work on incremental grid layouts~\cite{kieffer2013incremental}
was motivated by related work for grid layouts of biological 
networks~\cite{barsky2008cerebral,kojima2007efficient,li2005grid}, 
but aims to provide a more flexible mechanism for creating the constraints 
by supporting SBGN (Systems Biology Graphical Notation). In later
work, Kieffer et al.~\cite{kieffer2016hola} improve upon grid layout techniques
by first identifying the aesthetic criteria humans use for manual graph layout,
then producing a new algorithm that employs these techniques for improved,
human-like layouts.

Social networks often leverage force-directed layout techniques
to demonstrate the connectedness or clustering of the nodes. However, some
layouts may introduce additional separation or clustering
to highlight properties such as ethnographically-identified groups~\cite{rothenberg1998using},
the timeline of disease
exposure~\cite{fitzpatrick2001preventable,mcelroy2003network},
or differences in reported relationship types~\cite{fu2011hiv}.
For each of these domain areas, the visualizations are created using specially
designed tools or layout algorithms to leverage properties of the data
specific to the domain. With \projectname, we aim to reduce the barrier to
creating customized graph layouts by providing a compact way to specify
reusable domain-specific layouts that incorporate expert knowledge.
