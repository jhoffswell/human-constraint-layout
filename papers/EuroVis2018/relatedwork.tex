\section{Related Work}
There are many areas of related work surrounding graph visualization; we discuss general layout techniques that motivate this work and expand on the discussion of domain specific layouts.

\subsection{General Graph Layout}
Graph visualization has been a long-standing area of research and there are several common layout techniques for visualizing graph data including tree layouts or force-directed layouts \cite{herman2000graph,eades2010graph}. Graphviz~\cite{ellson2001graphviz} and Gephi~\cite{bastian2009gephi} are two examples of visualization engines specific to graph layout. D3.js~\cite{bostock:d3} is a JavaScript library that provides a number of built in layouts for graph data including force-directed and hierarchical layouts. WebCoLa~\cite{WebCoLa} is a JavaScript library for constraint-based layout that can be used alongside D3 or Cytoscape~\cite{shannon2003cytoscape}. These techniques emphasize certain structural properties, but are agnostic to the graph domain. While WebCoLa can support some customized constraints in addition to more general structure constraints, the specification of individual inter-node constraints can be labor-intensive and require additional programming expertise. Our language aims to reduce the burden of specifying constraints to produce generalizable layouts. 

In addition to these standard layout techniques, there is a large field of related work surrounding graph layout techniques that emphasize particular aesthetic or structural properties in the graph. \textsc{hola} \cite{kieffer2016hola} presents a layout engine to produce layouts similar to those produced by hand by identifying common aesthetic properties of the graph used in manual layouts and using the results to drive the design of a new layout algorithm. Kieffer et al. \cite{kieffer2013incremental} present a constraint-based layout for creating graphs with node and edge alignment, and demonstrate the feasibility of such a technique in an interactive system, Dunnart \cite{dwyer2008dunnart}. These customized layouts reflect general properties of the graph rather than domain specific details from the data itself. Our work focuses on providing a general language for supporting customized graph layouts based on domain specific data properties with minimal programming expertise.

\subsection{Domain Specific Graph Visualization}
Several tools have been developed to utilize domain specific information for graph layout, but these tools do not cover all possible domains of interest. In a blog post describing her approach to visualizing food webs~\cite{kearney2016blog}, Kearney notes that the node placement algorithm should \emph{``allow contraining y-position to match trophic level while allowing free movement in the x-direction. With no such algorithm seemingly readily available, I decided to create my own.''} Kearney has developed D3~\cite{kearney2017d3} and Ecopath~\cite{kearney2017ecopath} plugins to aid in the visualization of food webs. Baskerville et al. \cite{baskerville2011spatial} visualized the Serengeti food web and included an interactive graph \cite{baskerville2011interactive} created with D3 that approximates the layout shown in their paper. Motivated by this related work and the challenges Kearney describes, our constraint language aims to provide users with a lightweight strategy for identifying domain specific constraints.

Cerebral \cite{barsky2008cerebral} is a tool designed to visualize biological systems and support interactive exploration of different experimental conditions. Cytoscape \cite{shannon2003cytoscape} is a visualization system designed to explore biomolecular interaction networks and provides a framework for accepting customized plugins to extend the system, such as WebCoLa~\cite{WebCoLa}. Each of these tools was designed to address the needs of domain experts who were unable to find the necessary support within existing tools. Our work aims to reduce the barrier to creating customized systems by providing a compact way to specify domain specific graph layouts that leverage expert knowledge with minimal programming expertise.
