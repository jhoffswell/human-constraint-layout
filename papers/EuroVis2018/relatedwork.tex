\section{Related Work}
There are many areas of related work surrounding graph visualization; we
discuss general layout techniques that motivate this work and expand on the
discussion of domain specific layouts.

\subsection{General Graph Layout}
Graph visualization is a long-standing area of research. There are
several common layout techniques for network data, including tree
layouts, Sugiyama-style layouts, and force-directed layouts
\cite{herman2000graph,eades2010graph}. Graphviz~\cite{ellson2001graphviz}
and Gephi~\cite{bastian2009gephi} are two examples of visualization tools
focused on graph layout. D3.js~\cite{bostock:d3} is a JavaScript library
that provides a number of layouts for graph data including
force-directed and hierarchical layouts. WebCoLa~\cite{WebCoLa} is a
JavaScript library for constraint-based layout that can be used alongside
D3 or Cytoscape~\cite{shannon2003cytoscape}. These techniques \jheer{which techniques?} emphasize
certain structural properties \jheer{such as?}, but are agnostic as to the domain \jheer{What do you mean by ``domain''?}. While
WebCoLa can support some customized constraints in addition to more general
structure constraints, the specification of individual inter-node
constraints can be labor-intensive and require additional programming
expertise. Our language aims to reduce the burden of specifying constraints
to produce generalizable layouts.

\jheer{The prose here feels more *tool* focused (e.g., Graphviz, D3, Cytoscape) then *technique* focused (e.g., different layout approaches). I think you should take a step back and think about the big picture here. What are the common automatic (non-constrained based) approaches to node-link diagram layout? What structural features does each show? What are their limitations? Then go on to discuss contrained and/or customized layouts and their value for domain-specific graph layout. The DiG-CoLa paper does a nice job of this, contrasting force-directed and Sugiyama approaches, and showing how DiG-CoLa in some ways enables hybrids of the two. Also, right now the critical discussion of constrained layouts -- their main concepts, strengths, and weaknesses -- is missing.}

In addition to these standard layout techniques, there is a large field of
related work surrounding graph layout techniques that emphasize particular
aesthetic or structural properties in the graph. \textsc{hola}
\cite{kieffer2016hola} produces orthogonal layouts similar
to those produced by hand, informed by common aesthetic properties used in manual layouts. Kieffer et al.~\cite{kieffer2013incremental} present
a constraint-based layout for creating graphs with node and edge alignment,
and demonstrate the feasibility of such a technique in an interactive
system, Dunnart \cite{dwyer2008dunnart}.
\jheer{Weird that a 2013 paper has its feasiblity demonstrated by a 2008 paper...}
These customized layouts reflect
general properties of the graph rather than domain specific details from
the data itself. \jheer{Previous sentence a bit confusing. What domain-specific ``details'' or ``properties''? Perhaps a better description would help.} Our work focuses on providing a general language for
supporting customized graph layouts based on domain specific data
properties with minimal programming expertise.

\subsection{Domain Specific Graph Visualization}
\todo{Shift from tool to technique for some of these, cerebral is the most
  tool like of any of them} Several tools have been developed to utilize
domain specific information for graph layout, but these tools do not cover
all possible domains of interest. In a blog post describing her approach to
visualizing food webs~\cite{kearney2016blog}, Kearney notes that the node
placement algorithm should \emph{``allow contraining y-position to match
  trophic level while allowing free movement in the x-direction. With no
  such algorithm seemingly readily available, I decided to create my
  own.''} Kearney has developed plugins for D3~\cite{kearney2017d3} and
Ecopath~\cite{kearney2017ecopath} to aid in the visualization of
food webs. Baskerville et al.\ visualized the Serengeti food web
\cite{baskerville2011spatial}; in addition to the static visualization
presented in the paper, they developed an interactive graph
\cite{baskerville2011interactive} created with D3 that approximates this
static version.  Motivated by this related work and the
challenges Kearney describes, our constraint language aims to provide users
with a lightweight strategy for identifying domain specific constraints.

Cerebral \cite{barsky2008cerebral} is a tool designed to visualize
biological systems and support interactive exploration of different
experimental conditions. Cytoscape \cite{shannon2003cytoscape} is a
visualization system designed to explore biomolecular interaction networks
and provides a framework for accepting customized plugins to extend the
system, such as WebCoLa~\cite{WebCoLa}. Each of these tools was designed to
address the needs of domain experts who were unable to find the necessary
support within existing tools. Our work aims to reduce the barrier to
creating customized systems by providing a compact way to specify domain
specific graph layouts that leverage expert knowledge with minimal
programming expertise.
