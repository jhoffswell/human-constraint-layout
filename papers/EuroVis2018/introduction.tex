\section{Introduction}
By using an appropriate graph layout, node-link diagrams can effectively 
convey properties of the network structure, such as the hierarchy or network connectedness. 
Such visualizations are common across numerous domains, including 
social networks \cite{scott1988social,rothenberg1998using,fitzpatrick2001preventable,mcelroy2003network,fu2011hiv},
biological systems \cite{barsky2008cerebral,shannon2003cytoscape,gehlenborg2010visualization,saraiya2005visualizing,becker2001graph,kojima2007efficient,li2005grid},
and ecological networks \cite{hinke2004visualizing,harper2006dynamic,lavigne1996cod,baskerville2011spatial,yodzis1998local,cohen2003ecological,kearney2016blog,benson2016higher,kruger2017}. 
Graph layouts may utilize domain-specific properties 
to emphasize relevant patterns in the data.
In a biological pathway, nodes can be layered by their
subcellular location to visualize the cellular structure
(Figure~\ref{fig:tlr4-layout}). The additional ``transcriptionally regulated genes'' layer
can further show the outcomes of this network, grouped by molecular function.

Many domain-specific layout techniques address particular needs
for customized layouts~\cite{barsky2008cerebral,genc2003constrained,shannon2003cytoscape,kearney2017d3,kearney2017ecopath}. These
techniques leverage common structural properties that are significant to the
domain, such as known data hierarchies including cellular 
structure (Figure~\ref{fig:tlr4-layout}) or trophic level
(Figure~\ref{fig:kruger-layout},~\ref{fig:serengeti-layout}), as a guiding property of the
layout. However, these techniques rarely generalize beyond the domain for
which they were designed. Furthermore, many
other domains lack customized layout tools despite their potential utility.
When a layout technique does not exist for the
domain of interest, users must either fit their data
to available techniques or design and implement a new algorithm.
Creating a customized layout algorithm requires both
domain and programming expertise, and so introduces a gap between 
analysis needs and the techniques available to handle those needs.

Constraints can be used to specify desired layout properties by
allowing the designer to control the positions of nodes using
domain-specific information.  However, many existing techniques
for constraint layout require the user to define constraints
on individual nodes or node pairs. This process can be labor
intensive, requiring thousands of similar constraints and careful reasoning
about which nodes should be constrained. Moreover, instance-level constraints 
(e.g., defined \emph{extensionally} via node indices) prevent
reuse of a layout across various graphs from the same domain.

To enable customized domain-specific layouts with reduced
programming effort, we contribute \projectname: a domain-specific language for
specifying high-level constraints for graph layout. Users partition nodes
into sets based on node or graph properties, and apply layout constraints
to these sets. This approach allows users to specify layout
requirements at a high level, deferring the generation of
instance-level constraints to the underlying runtime system. These constraint
definitions reduce specification effort while enabling highly
customized and reusable graph layouts.

We implemented a \projectname compiler, which generates instance-level 
constraints for WebCoLa~\cite{WebCoLa}, a JavaScript library for constraint-based
graph layout. To demonstrate the expressiveness of \projectname, we
recreate several customized layouts found in the scientific research 
literature. We show that users can compactly specify complex layouts that resemble
those produced by custom layout engines, and can reapply these
specifications across different graphs. Our \projectname specifications
can reduce the number of constraints written by the user by one to two 
orders of magnitude.
